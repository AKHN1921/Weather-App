# homework-6
This is my homework for week 6

First, I copied and reviewed the user story, acceptance criteria, and mock-up;
"Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard"
"User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly"
"Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
Mock-Up"

Next, I got an API key from (https://home.openweathermap.org/)(APIKey ="81056d6729846ca66cccd988812311e5") and created a variable for it in javascript. 

Next I start adding some basics to the css and html files by copying some code from previous assignments.

Next, I referenced (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_search_menu.asp) for adding and customizing a side search menu in html, css, and js
